 The classic Winamp2 skin for VLC.

 This skin was originally created by [Baegus](https://www.deviantart.com/baegus/), but it lacked a control to show the VLC video window; if you closed the VLC video window, there was no path to make it reappear. This "fork" transforms both the Winamp image logo in the main window and the Winamp text logo in the small/focus window into clickable buttons that open the VLC video window.

 Released under the same license terms (CC BY-NC 3.0) as the original skin.
